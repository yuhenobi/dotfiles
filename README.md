# Quick start
Run that on the Terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/yuhenobi/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

A bootstrap.sh script will:
- Install homebrew package manager and with his help all software that defined in a Brewfile
- Make symlinks to Git configuration files and Zsh profile

## Planning
- Add macOS system preferences configuration
